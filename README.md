## Overview

This project was built as the capstone for Computer Programming at Niagara College. Itâ€™s a tracking and scheduling web/desktop app that is intended to help our client
approach things in a more modern and sustainable way. Previously all of their shipping, progress goals, client and customer information was maintained through excel spreadsheets.

## Features
Key features:
- A scalable database of vendors and customers.
- A scalable database of orders.
- Individual or group tracking of active orders for vendors and/or customers.(TJHyde-Code)
- Login authentication and permissions to prevent unwanted data entry/manipulation
- Stylized step-wizard to walk the user through creating a product order. (TJHyde-Code & Team Member)
- The ability to archive certain things such as vendors or customers so that they no longer appear in order creation to prevent accidental usage. (Active orders linked to them remain)
- An auto generating Gantt chart to track key dates within single product order to track progress of the order. (Approval drawing, reviews, parts, read to ship etc.) (TJHyde-Code)
